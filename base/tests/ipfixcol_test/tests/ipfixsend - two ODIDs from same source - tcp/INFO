Until some version of the TCP input plugin, ODIDs were not used for identifying transport sessions. As such, when data for multiple ODIDs was sent by the same flow exporter, the input_info struct would be the same for all ODIDs. The problem of this is that both transport sessions get the first received ODID. This may be problematic for plugins that maintain state per transport session (and ODID). Another problem of the original code was that sequence number tracking, for example, would yield many errors, since IPFIXcol did not track sequence numbers per ODID.
