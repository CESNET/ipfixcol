 * \brief Simple ring buffer for passing data between one write thread and one

 * reading the data is usually as follows:
 *
 * - rbuffer_read (); <br/>
 * - do some work with read data; <br/>
 * - rbuffer_remove_reference ();
 *
 * This way data are freed by rbuffer_remove_reference() when all reading
 * threads already read them.
 *
 * Thread calling rbuffer_read() must specify which index it wants to read and
 * the index must be incremented continuously.
